UD	UniMorph	Issue	Message
Person=0	0		
Person=1	1		
Person=2	2		
Person=3	3		
Person=4	4	Yes	@haijme: in UniMorph, 4th person is a "catch-all" category, while 4th in UD is dedicated to Proximate/Obiviate difference like Navajo. Some linguists (including linguists for Ainu) use 4th to denote the "logophoric" person. In her typological textbook, Siewierska (2004) claimed that 4th is not a meaningful category.

Animacy=Anim	ANIM		There are cases of, e.g., "ANIM;ACC" as well as "ACC;ANIM"... is this relevant? @jcsg: The ordering isn't important.

Case=Voc	VOC		
Case=Loc	ESS	Yes	@jcsg: ESS means "stationarily located" and leaves the issue of in/on/at underspecified.
Case=Par	PRT		
Case=Dis	DIST	Yes	@jcsg: If this doesn't occur outside of Hungarian, it'd be appropriate to use a LGSPEC feature. If it is used by other languages, I'd propose a case feature DISTR.
Case=Ess	FRML		
Case=Tra	TRANS		
Case=Com	COM		
Case=Abe	PRIV		
Case=Ine	IN+ESS		@jcsg: The annotations with the ??? marks were all right!
Case=Ill	IN+ALL		
Case=Ela	IN+ABL		
Case=Add	IN+ALL;LGSPEC1		@jcsg: This is either semantically the same as illative (IN+ALL) or very slightly different, in which case it could have a LGSPEC feature in addition to (IN+ALL). UD link: http://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/all.html#Add

Degree=Cmp	CMPR		@hajime Unimorph COMPV is UD Case=Cmp
Degree=Equ	EQT		@hajime Unimorph EQTV is UD Case=Equ
Degree=Pos		Yes	@hajime UD positive is a kind of "base" values; no counterpart in the UniMorph comparison dimension
Degree=Sup	RL		@hajime UD superlative requires comparison ("The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other objects within a set."), so its counterpart in UniMorph is RL  (rather than RL+AB)

Reflex=Yes	REFL		
Poss=Yes		Yes	@jcsg: This is an area where there is a core difference between UD and UniMorph. UniMorph uses composed features of PSS+1+S = the feature PSS1S = "my". UD combines this Poss=Yes with person and other features. UniMorph uses composite tags to avoid needing to disambiguate person as a verb actant and person as a possessor. This may be an issue for inflected, non-finite verbs, but may not be. If the UD proposal is viable for UniMorph, we could adopt that practice since there is a core POS division between verbal parts of speech and nominal parts of speech.
NumType=Card		Yes	@hajime: the current UniMorph draft doesn't have the NumType dimension
NumType=Dist		Yes	
NumType=Frac		Yes	
NumType=Mult		Yes	
NumType=Ord		Yes	@hajime: "Where appropriate, ordinal numerals (first, second, etc.) often behave as adjectives and should be classified as such." (UniMorph draft, p. 40)
